### Console Logging

![](Console.jpg)

The Console can be helpful tool for diagnosing QGroundControl problems. It can be found in the Setttings view. It allows you turn turn on/off the logging options available in QGroundControl. Click the "Set Logging" button to select logging options.

##### Commonly used logging options

* LinkManagerLog, MultiVehicleManagerLog - Debug connection problems.
* LinkManagerVerboseLog - Very noisy connection problem debugging. Continuous output of available serial ports.
* FirmwareUpgradeLog - Debug firmware flash issues.
* ParameterLoaderLog - Debug parameter load problems.
* ParameterLoaderVerboseLog - Debug parameter load problems with full trace of parameters coming/going/in system.
* MissionManagerLog - Debug mission protocol issues.
* RadioComponentControllerLog - Debug Radio calibration issues.

##### Logging from the command line

An alternate mechanism for logging is using the --logging command line option. This is handy if you are trying to get logs from a situation where QGroundControl crashes.

How you do this and where the traces are output vary by OS:

  * Windows
    * You must open a command prompt, change directory to the qgroundcontrol.exe location, and run it from there:
    * <code>cd "\Program Files (x86)\qgroundcontrol"
qgroundcontrol --logging:full</code>
    * When QGC starts you should see a separate console window open which will have the log output
  * OSX
    * You must run QGC from Terminal. The Terminal app is located in Applications/Utilities. Once Terminal is open paste the following into it:
    * <code>cd /Applications/qgroundcontrol.app/Contents/MacOS/
./qgroundcontrol --logging:full</code>
    * Log traces will output to the Terminal window.
  * Linux
    * <code>./qgroundcontrol-start.sh --logging:full</code>
    * Log traces will output to the shell you are running from.
