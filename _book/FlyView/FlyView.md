The Fly View is the main view you will use while flying your vehicle. You can switch between a map view and a video view (if available).

## Map

The map will show you the positions of all the vehicles you are connected to. It will also show you the mission for the current vehicle.

## Fly Tools

### Center Map
The Center Map tool allow you to center the map around various points such as home position, vehicle and so forth.

### Map Type
This tool allows you to change the current map type between Street, Satellite and Hybrid (Street+Satellite). The default map provider is Bing since it seems to provide better Hybrid maps. You can change the map provider from the General page of Settings.
