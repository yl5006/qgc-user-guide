*Note: This image is from a vehicle running PX4 Pro firmware. ArduPilot works similary, just the parameter set will differ.*

The Parameters screen allows you to modify any of the parameters associated with the vehicle.

The parameters are organized in groups. You can select a group of parameters to view by clicking on one of the group buttons to the left. In the example image the "Battery Calibration" group is selected.

### Changing a value

To change the value of a parameter click on the parameter value in the list. This will open a side dialog which allows you to update the value and also provides additional detailed information on the parameter.
